# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Audio and subtitles translation scripts are no longer injected when the feature is disabled, preventing automatic track switching back to the original.

### Performances
- Url changes are now ignored in irrelevant iframes (such as live chat and background authentication pages), preventing unnecessary URL change detections and observer cleanup.

## [2.21.2] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Added "Dev Log" toggle in extra settings (popup and settings page): enables/disables console logs for debugging. Disabled by default.

### Fixed
- Extension is now fully disabled on YouTube Music (music.youtube.com) to prevent slowdowns and unnecessary interactions, as the extension is not intended to operate on this domain for now.

## [2.21.1] - 2026-03-05

### Performances
optimize waitForElement to reduce DOM queries (checking addedNodes only)


## [2.21.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- Japanese (ja) translation (Thanks to [monta-gh](https://github.com/monta-gh))

## [2.20.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- Fixed main description: the expanded description is now only filled when actually expanded, preventing the original (untranslated) description from being visible in collapsed mode. This restores the correct collapsed/expanded behavior and prevents double rendering or early reveal of the original text.

## [2.20.0] - 2025-12-03

### Added
- Spanish language locales for the extension. (Thanks to [Seva41](https://github.com/Seva41))
- Support for YouTube embeds inside external iframes (e.g., watch2gether or any site hosting an inline player).

## [2.19.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- Feedback card title (on home page "What did you think of this video") are now replaced by original title if needed.
- Added locales support. Added French and Ukrainian translation (thanks to [btncua](https://github.com/btncua) for Ukrainian translation).

## [2.18.2] - 2025-11-18

### Added 
- Ukrainian language is now available for audio & subtitles tracks

### Fixed
- Reverted changes on description from 2.18.0. (Added debounce back for description replacement : this means the flash on hovering translated description is bac -for now-, but no risk of infinite loop)

## [2.18.1] - 2025-11-12

### Fixed 
- Removed hard coded white color for main description font (for light theme)
- Allow dots in channel handle extraction for channel renderer

## [2.18.0] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- **Mobile support**: All main features (Titles, Descriptions, Channel name & description, Thumbnails, Subtitles) are now supported on mobile YouTube (m.youtube.com). Except for Audio Tracks feature, it remains **DESKTOP-ONLY** for now; mobile support is not planned yet.

### Fixed
- **Description hover flash**: Eliminated visual flash when hovering over short description

## [2.17.2] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Added dynamic review link in support toast: displays appropriate store name (Mozilla Add-ons, Chrome Web Store, or Microsoft Store) based on detected browser.
- Added browser detection utilities (`isFirefox()`, `isChromium()`, `isEdge()`) for platform-specific features.

### Fixed
- Fixed subtitle track matching to handle regional language variants: tracks like "en-US" and "en-GB" now correctly match ASR tracks with base language code "en". This resolves cases where manual subtitles in original language were not detected due to region-specific language codes.
- Fixed race conditions in description processing during SPA navigation. This prevents incorrect descriptions from being displayed or cached when users navigate rapidly between videos, especially when moving from a translated video to a non-translated one.

## [2.17.1] - 2025-10-20

### Fix
- Improved chapter detection in video descriptions: timestamps at the end of lines are now recognized as valid chapters.
- Isolated timestamps (not surrounded by at least an other chapter lines) are no longer considered chapters, reducing false positives in descriptions with time mentions.

## [2.17.0] - 2025-10-17

### Fix
- **Chapters fixes**:
  - Check chapters translation even when description is original.
  
- Improved video processing to ensure descriptions and chapters are only applied when both DOM and URL video IDs match, preventing race conditions during SPA navigation that could cause content from one video to be applied to another.

### Changed
- Updated application logo.

## [2.16.0] - 2025-10-16

### Feat
- **InfoCards Support**: Original titles are now restored for video annotations (infocards) in video descriptions and their corresponding overlay teasers

### Fix
- Fixed missing observer initialization after full page reload by manually calling `handleUrlChange()` in `setupUrlObserver`. This ensures all observers and features are correctly set up whether the user navigates via SPA or refreshes the browser.
- Thumbnail Lazy Loading Support: Added passive observation system for lazy-loaded thumbnails. Loaded video with thumbnails ouside of viewport were not processed.

### Performances
- Removed redundant call to browsing videos refresher in observers.

## [2.15.2] - 2025-10-09

### Fix
- Added debounce timers to mutation observers that didn't have them yet (titles, descriptions, chapters, channel info) to prevent infinite loops and improve performance stability when conflicting with other extensions or rapid DOM changes.

## [2.15.1] - 2025-10-03

### Fix
- Updated channel name selector to support the latest YouTube channel page layout (new h1.dynamicTextViewModelH1 structure).

## [2.15.0] - 2025-09-26

### Feat
- Support for restoring original titles in post video suggestions grid (the videos shown after the main video ends, in the fullscreen grid overlay).

## [2.14.2] - 2025-09-24

### Fix
- Support all language codes in thumbnail restoration
- Ensure settings completeness and type safety during initialization and migration

### Changed
- Centralized settings sanitization logic: all settings (content, background, popup) now use the new `sanitizeSettings` utility to auto-fill missing keys, remove unknown keys, and fix type mismatches. This improves robustness and maintainability.


## [2.14.1] - 2025-09-19

### Fix
- Prevented unnecessary page title updates in `refreshMainTitle` and `refreshEmbedTitle` functions when the page title is already correct. Avoids redundant DOM updates and logs.


## [2.14.0] - 2025-09-16

### Feat
- Added an 'Original Thumbnails' toggle to popup / settings page.

### Fix 
- Updated channel description selectors to support the latest YouTube channel page DOM structure.
- On subscription page, video descriptions are now original when videos are displayed as List.
- Added a debounce to page title mutation observer to prevent potential infinite title replacement (could cause high CPU usage and tab crash)


## [2.13.0] - 2025-09-06

### Feat
- Translated thumbnails are now back to original

### Fix
- YNT now handles YT's new player : fixed chapters tooltip and video title in full screen. (kept it working with old player for now)

## [2.12.4] - 2025-09-04

### Fixed
- Fixed a conflict with SponsorBlock: chapter button in the player now always displays the original current chapter title.

### Style
- Improved popup / settings page (features name)

### Fixed

## [2.12.3] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- Fixed some browsing video titles not being processed due to YouTube HTML structure changes: added support for new `yt-lockup-metadata-view-model__title` class selector alongside existing ones for improved compatibility

## [2.12.2] - 2025-08-26

### Fix
- Fixed Auto Generated Subtitles not being displayed when subtitles language was "original" & Auto Generated Subtitles feature enabled.

## [2.12.1] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- Fixed cache timestamp persistence by storing cleanup timestamps in local storage instead of memory variables
- Cache expiration now works correctly after browser restarts (24h)
- Unified cache storage structure under single 'ynt-cache' object to prevent local storage pollution


## [2.12.0] - 2025-08-23

### Added
- Added a "Clear cache" button in the popup and settings page to allow users to clear cached titles and descriptions when experiencing incorrect content

### Fixed
- Improved cache priority order: cache is now checked first, then pre-fetched titles only if cache is empty
- Fixed cache overwriting issues where pre-fetched titles were incorrectly overwritten by empty cache values
- Removed redundant description caching in content observer to centralize cache logic in validation function

## [2.11.0] - 2025-08-21

### Feature
- Added a setting "Enable Auto Generated Subtitles", if prefered language is not available in a manual subtitle track, subtitles will be auto generated in this language.
- Migration system for existing users to add ASR setting (defaults to disabled)


### Fixed

- Improved error handling for content script communication


## [2.10.13] - 2025-08-17

### Fixed

- Fixed Mini Player title still translated.
- Fixed an issue where the main video title and description remained translated on the first video opened after a full page load or direct link.

## [2.10.12] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed
- Improved playlist detection: channel grid playlists (including those loaded on scroll) are now correctly ignored, preventing their titles from being overwritten by the first video title in the playlist.
- Added grid parent observer to all type of pages, to update titles if a filter is applyed. (Was only added on home page before, but filters also exists elsewhere)
- Notification dropdown observer now only activates when the menu-style is set to notifications, preventing false positives from other dropdowns like settings.

## [2.10.11] - 2025-08-08

### Fixed
- Always decode channel handle if it is percent-encoded (UTF-8), as happens for multibyte handles

## [2.10.10] - 2025-08-05

### Fixed
- Exclude suggestion link text from description extraction for accurate comparison
- Outdated Xcode Project file.
- Missing iconset copy in the shell script for Safari.

### Changed
- Updated iconset to match the required by macOS.

## [2.10.8] - 2025-07-31

### Style
- Improve reload button contrast and add refresh icon for clarity

### Fix
- Channel page: Only the real (visible and non-empty) video description is now restored for each video. Fixed an issue where the extension would attempt to restore descriptions for all video thumbnails, even when no description was present.

## [2.10.7] - 2025-07-30

### Changed
- Removed automatic reload of YouTube tabs on extension install. Instead, a clear warning is now displayed on the Welcome page, with a button allowing users to manually reload active YouTube tabs. Hibernating or backgroud tabs are ignored.

## [2.10.6] - 2025-07-25

### Refactored
- Major refactor of main video description logic: code is now modular, respects SRP, and uses the new centralized cache system. Timestamp and URL parsing are now handled by dedicated utilities. File and function names have been clarified for maintainability.

## [2.10.3] - 2025-07-23

### Feat
- Added a persistent cache system for video descriptions using `browser.storage.local`. The cache now survives page reloads and browser restarts, with a maximum of 50 entries and a 12-hour expiration.

### Refactor
- Added a persistent cache system for video titles using `browser.storage.local`. The cache now survives page reloads and browser restarts, with a maximum of 1000 entries and a 24-hour expiration.

### Fix
- Fixed logic to ensure titles and descriptions are only cached when actually used, and always checked in cache before making network requests.


## [2.10.2] - 2025-07-22
- Added a toast for support.

## [2.10.1] - 2025-07-22

### Feat
- Improved grid observer cleanup: all grid observers are now stored in an array and properly disconnected to prevent duplicate callbacks after SPA navigation.
- Added parent attribute observer on `#primary > ytd-rich-grid-renderer` to reliably detect filter changes on the home page.
- Refactored popup toggles: now use a generic handler for all toggles, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
- Added TypeScript support to `bundle-scripts.js` for content scripts.

### Fix
- Added a background to white text in console logs for better readability in light mode DevTools.

### Docs
- Updated issue template.

## [2.10.0] - 2025-07-16

### Feat
- Channel name & description is now fetched from InnerTube if Data API is not enabled. (HL must be specified or YT pick the one from settings, meaning still translated. So I added Lao to HL, chances for meeting a translation with this language are almost 0)
- Channel name & description (Channel handle block) is now handled on search page.
- Video Title & Description of player's video on channel page is now handled
- Some channels have video list with descriptions, they are handled now.

### Changes
- Changed default subtitles language to "Always Disabled".

### Refactored
- process individual title fetches in parallel instead of sequential for refreshBrowsingVideos
- If YouTube Data API feature is enabled, a batch request is made for titles & search descriptions for less network traffic and resquests consumption

## [2.9.0] - 2025-07-14

### Feat
- Added InnerTube as a fallback method to fetch video titles, and as main method to featch video descriptions on search & history page.

### Refactored
- Removed Beta Features : Description & Titles fallback via Isolated Player.

## [2.8.3] - 2025-07-12

### Fix
- Improved playlist detection: now supports both playlist containers, preventing playlist titles from being overwritten by first video title from the playlist.

## [2.8.2] - 2025-07-12

### Fix
- Observe all video grids on home/channel pages to handle SPA navigation and popstate: ensures mutations are detected even if multiple grids remain in the DOM after navigation (fixes missing title updates after back/forward navigation due to DOM reuse).

## [2.8.1] - 2025-07-11

### Fix
- Video player settings now correctly use the new settings object structure with 'enabled' property for audio and subtitles translation. (was causing subtitles to be enabled to selected language even if disabled...)
- Recommended titles are now 'untranslated' again. (Added support for new HTML selector)

## [2.8.0] - 2025-07-10

### Fix
- Channel Name & Description, use channel handle for API request instead of ID from dom (not reliable)

### Feat
- Added support of video descriptions on search page

## [2.7.1] - 2025-07-09

### Feat
- Use channels endpoint instead of search for channel info (1 unit vs 100, my bad...), add fallback to fetch channel description by handle when ID is missing in DOM (SPA navigation support)

## [2.7.0] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- DeArrow custom titles are now ignored by the extension.
- Added support for channel descriptions & title restoration using YouTube Data API v3 (if a valid API key is provided in extension popup).

### Added
- Chapters on the right panel (opened via chapter button in the player) are not translated anymore.
- Video end screen titles are not translated anymore.

### Refactored
- Extracted video ID parsing logic from `refreshBrowsingVideos` into a dedicated utility function `extractVideoIdFromUrl` in `src/content/utils/video.ts`
- Extracted browsing title element validation logic into a dedicated function `shouldProcessBrowsingElement`
- Extracted browsing title element state check logic into a dedicated function `checkElementProcessingState`
- Extracted original title fetching logic from `refreshBrowsingVideos` into a dedicated function `fetchOriginalTitle`
- Notification title processing now uses the unified `extractVideoIdFromUrl` utility for video ID extraction.
- Shorts titles retrieval now uses the unified `fetchMainTitle` function for main shorts titles and `fetchOriginalTitle` for alternative shorts formats.

- Notification popup titles now use the unified `fetchOriginalTitle` logic for original title retrieval.
- Extracted main title retrieval logic into a dedicated `fetchMainTitle` function, now used in `refreshMainTitle`, `refreshEmbedTitle`, and `refreshMiniplayerTitle`.

## [2.6.0] - 2025-07-04

### Fixed
- Fixed original description replacement for search results videos with chapters: now also targets `.metadata-snippet-container-one-line` containers, ensuring all search result types are handled.
- Ensure individual settings properties are completed without overwriting user values in popup

### Added
- Added options page support for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari: users can now access extension settings via the standard "Extension options" link in browser extension management pages.

### Refactored
- Renamed `welcome.html` to `settings.html` for better clarity and dual usage.
- The settings page now supports both first install welcome mode and standard options page access.
- Updated all manifests to declare the options page entry point.

- Removed all usage of TypeScript's `outFile` option and switched to a fully modular codebase using explicit ES module imports/exports.
- Updated all source files to use ES module imports/exports where necessary.
- Integrated esbuild as the bundler for content, background, and popup scripts, replacing the old TypeScript outFile build.
- Simplified and modernized the build process for better maintainability and scalability.

- Extracted all description-related logic from `refreshBrowsingVideos` into two dedicated functions: `shouldProcessSearchDescriptionElement` and `processSearchDescriptionElement`, now placed in the appropriate file to better respect single responsibility principles. This is the first step of a broader refactor to further simplify and clarify the orchestration logic.

- Clarify settings type checks and remove unnecessary boolean coercion in search description logic

## [2.5.11] - 2025-07-02

### Quickfix
- Fixed settings migration: fallback options (`titlesFallbackApi`, `descriptionSearchResults`) are now correctly migrated to the new `youtubeIsolatedPlayerFallback` object, preventing popup settings from breaking after update.

## [2.5.1] - 2025-07-02

### Added
- Added YouTube Data API v3 fallback for notification titles: notification titles now use the Data API as a fallback.

### Fixed

- Use more specific selector for notification dropdown observer (ytd-popup-container tp-yt-iron-dropdown[vertical-align="top"])
- Improved playlist observer: now detects changes inside playlists, ensuring video title updates are always handled.
- Updated album/playlist detection: reliably distinguishes albums/playlists from individual playlist videos, preventing album/playlist titles from being overwritten by the first video title.

### Refactored
- Unified settings structure: audio and subtitles settings now use objects with `enabled` and `language` properties.
- Grouped experimental fallback options (`titles`, `searchResultsDescriptions`) under `youtubeIsolatedPlayerFallback` for better clarity and maintainability.
- Updated all related code, types, and popup logic for consistency.

## [2.5.0] - 2025-07-01

  - Positioned as second fallback (after oEmbed, before experimental Player API) for optimal reliability
  - Extended to search results descriptions: API retrieval before experimental Player API fallback
  - Proper error handling and logging for API failures

### Fixed
- Check if current notification title contains original title instead of strict equality, to handle prefix in textContent
- Fixed popup settings synchronization between popup and welcome pages by adding proper element existence checks

## [2.4.40] - 2025-06-30

### Added
- Added original title restoration for notification popup: notification dropdown is now observed and notification titles are replaced with their original (non-translated) versions when the popup is opened or updated.

## [2.4.32] - 2025-06-27

### Fixed
- Fixed description comparison for non-latin languages (Korean, Japanese, etc.): normalization now preserves all Unicode letters and numbers, ensuring correct detection of original descriptions regardless of language. (there was issues with some descriptions in a non latin alphabet)

## [2.4.31] - 2025-06-26

### Fixed
- Prevent concatenated titles from being copied into the title attribute when original title retrieval fails (ynt-fail): now always restores the parent title instead of propagating a polluted value.

## [2.4.30] - 2025-06-25

### Refactored
- Browsing titles : remove span logic and update video title directly via textContent for clarity and maintainability

## [2.4.25] - 2025-06-23

### Fixed
- Fully clean extension attributes, spans, and direct text nodes in video title elements when the videoId changes to prevent concatenated titles caused by DOM recycling
- Recalculate tooltip position for BETA options when advanced settings section is shown to prevent tooltip overflow in the
- Applyed changes from [Tommodev](https://github.com/tommodev-ctrl)'s PR: Made popup more understandable (Features titles, tooltips..) 

## [2.4.24] - 2025-06-22

### Fixed
- Added delayed refreshes (setTimeout) after sidebar and search results mutations to improve reliability of original title replacement when YouTube updates DOM asynchronously (temporary workaround until a cleaner solution is implemented)
- Improved recommended videos observer to handle different DOM structures when user is logged in vs logged out (observes ytd-item-section-renderer for logged-in users, #items directly for logged-out users)

### Refactored
- Added "Advanced Settings" section in popup and moved BETA features inside

## [2.4.21] - 2025-06-21

### Added
- Added error logging for search descriptions: now logs any error returned by the injected script for better debugging

### Fixed
- Dynamic detection of search results page for SPA navigation, ensuring description replacement works after navigation without reload
- Stop and reset player after processing a video, avoiding video being counted as watched in YouTube history.

## [2.4.2] - 2025-06-21

### Technical Improvements
- Merged description and title processing into unified video processing function for improved performance and reduced complexity

## [2.4.1] - 2025-06-18

### Fixed
- Prevented main video settings from being skipped when a description or title fallback is triggered: video events from isolated players are now ignored, eliminating the need for global timeouts or flags and ensuring correct behavior when switching videos rapidly.
